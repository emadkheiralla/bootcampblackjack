Bootcamp Blackjack is a final project showcased by full stack developers Emad Kheiralla, Andrew Murriel, Gabriel Ossers, Daniel Lopez, and Dion Bailey.  There are many blackjack games across the web, but what Bootcamp Blackjack offers is far superior since its use of many different coding languages.  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, NodeJS, EJS, AngularJS, Mongo DB and a host of coding languages are used to create Bootcamp Blackjack, an aesthetically pleasing and seamlessly displayed single page application (SPA).  Feel free to create an account, and try your luck at winning it big on Bootcamp Blackjack.  First clone the repository, and the server is in the server.js file listening on port 3000.
